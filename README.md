# speedy

##### Speedy was an idea that came to me as I constantly had to type 'cd /long/path/to/distant/directory'. If I was in a specific directory, I had to cd out of that directory, then to the one that I wanted. Now, Speedy lets me choose an alias via arrows, and opens up a new terminal in the directory for that alias.


## Installation
``` bash
go get github.com/jordan-patterson/speedy
go install
```
